# ASSEMBLER_32_BIT_for_RISCV_Arechitecture

Fully operational RISCV Architecture 32 Bit Assembler with custom In-MemoryComputing Memristor crossbar support

The ASSEMBLER can recieve a RISCV program and convert it into a '0' and '1' input file that can be loaded into a 32 Bit RISC-V Verilog processor memory.

 

The tool supports:

-The base 32 Bit Instrction Set

-Variable declaration

-Relative Memory refferencing

-A custom set of commands that can interface with Memristor crossbar support for In-Memory Computing, increasing the throughput of the Data Path

 

The project was designed to simplify the coding process for the 32 bit RISC-V architecture of the following repo: [CPU_32bit_pipelined_Virtual_Memristor_Memory] (https://github.com/konsmall/CPU_32bit_pipelined_In_Memory_Computing_Virtual_Memristor_Memory)
